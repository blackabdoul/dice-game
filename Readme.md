# 🎲 Dicee Game — JavaScript DOM Mini-Project

A simple, fun Dice game built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
Each page reload triggers a random dice roll for Player 1 and Player 2 — and the script declares the winner instantly!
Perfect beginner-friendly DOM practice project.

## 🚀 Features

🎲 Random dice roll generator

👥 Auto-winner selection (Player 1 / Player 2 / Draw)

🌈 Styled UI with Google Fonts

🧩 Clean and simple JavaScript DOM manipulation

⚡ Instant results on page reload

## 🧠 How It Works

Each dice image is updated using a randomly generated number (1–6).

The JS script compares both results.

The winner text updates dynamically:

Player 1 wins

Player 2 wins

Draw!

The verdict changes after every browser refresh, making each outcome completely random.

This makes it a fun and simple way to decide casual family decisions — who picks the movie, who gets the last slice, who does the dishes, etc. 🎲✨
